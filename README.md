====================

Written in PHP. I'm sorry.

0. git submodule init && git submodule update
0. cp config.php{.dist,}
0. Create api stuff from https://apps.twitter.com and put it in config.php
0. php block.php
0. to leave it running forever : ` while [ 0 ]; do php block.php; sleep 60; done`

Eat shit, sponsors!
